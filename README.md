# Travel Journal

#### Description: Travel journal. Tools used: React, CSS, HTML.

I designed a travel journal that shows places I've been in the last few years. For this project, I made a reusable Card component that receives data from the data file I made. This project has helped me learn about props and making reusable components. I really like the final result.
